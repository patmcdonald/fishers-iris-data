## Background information on the data
### What is the data
The Iris flower data set is considered a classic data set for use in statistics [1, 2].  The data set contains 150 objects of three different classes and four features: three species of North American *Iris* flower (*Iris setosa*, *I. virginica* and *I. versicolor*) with 50 numeric values per species of sepal length and width, and petal length and width, in cm.  It is available for download since 1988 from UC [Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) [3].

### Who collated it and why
The data were collated by Edgar Anderson for his publication in 1935 to as the species were seen as an ideal study system within which test hypotheses about intra- and interspecific morphological variation, and consequent inference of the evolutionary relationships between them [4, 5]. As *I. versicolor* is geographically and morphologically intermediate between *I. virginica* and *I. setosa*, Anderson aimed to test whether *I. versicolor* originated as a result of a recent hybridisation event between *I. virginica* and *I. setosa*, or whether it was a progenitor of either species [5].

### How data were collected
Two of the species, *I. setosa* and *I. versicolor* were collected on the collected in the Gaspé Peninsula, Quebec, Canada "all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus", and published by Edgar in 1935 [1,5].  It is presumed that the same apparatus and rigor were applied to the measurement of *I. virginica* before Edgar shared the data with the British statistician and biologist Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher in 1936 [7].  

### Why it’s still in use today
Given that it was one of the first widely available and high profile ‘real data’ sets, it’s use proliferated as a pedagogical resource for teaching statistical methodologies [2].  The data were originally used by Fisher as an example for multivariate discriminate analyses [7].  Subsequently, the Irish data set has become one of the mode widely used reference data set for classification and prediction studies, and more recently for machine learning approaches to clustering, classification and pattern recognition [8].
